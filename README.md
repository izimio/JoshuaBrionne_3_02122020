OC web dev formation's 3rd project


In this project i was missioned to recreate the model of an application based on restaurants.
In fact, this application would propose restaurants to the customers and show them there menus.

This project include Sass and a lot of other CSS's propreties such as radient and relative / absolute position.

Moreover the main theme of this project is based on the CSS animation. So we had to create a like animation, and a scrolling animation !

This project was made as fast as the 2nd (in a week-end).
